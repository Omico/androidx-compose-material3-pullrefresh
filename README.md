# androidx-compose-material3-pullrefresh

This is a simple wrapper for Jetpack Compose Material3's `PullRefreshIndicator`. The official implementation is not compatible with Material 3 theme.

Official documentation
see [here](<https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/pullrefresh/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).pullRefresh(androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh.PullRefreshState,kotlin.Boolean)>).

Note that you should change all package name from `androidx.compose.material.pullrefresh` into `androidx.compose.material3.pullrefresh`.

## Usage

This library only supports using composite build to import to your project because it will be archived when the official library is released.

> Note: `<androidx-compose-material3-pullrefresh-path>` is the path to this library. For example, if you put this library in `<your-app>/libraries/androidx-compose-material3-pullrefresh`, then the path is `libraries/androidx-compose-material3-pullrefresh`. Or you can use absolute path too.

Copy `<androidx-compose-material3-pullrefresh-path>/local.properties.template` to `<androidx-compose-material3-pullrefresh-path>/local.properties` and follow the instructions in the file to fit your environment.

### For try it out or contribution purpose

Open `<androidx-compose-material3-pullrefresh-path>/example` in Android Studio and run it.

### Use it in your project

In your root project's `settings.gradle.kts` or `settings.gradle` file, add the following:

```kotlin
includeBuild("<androidx-compose-material3-pullrefresh-path>") {
    dependencySubstitution {
        substitute(module("me.omico.compose:compose-material3-pullrefresh"))
            .using(project(":material3-pullrefresh"))
    }
}
```

In your app module's `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle` file, add the following:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("me.omico.compose:compose-material3-pullrefresh")
}
```
